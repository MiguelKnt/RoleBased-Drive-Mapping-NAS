# NAS Network Mapping with Active Directory Integration

## Project Overview
In this project, I configured **TrueNAS** and implemented **role-based access control** for file sharing within a network. I created a **static IP**, a **storage pool**, and an **SMB share**. By mapping network drives and managing permissions through security groups, I ensured that only authorized users could access specific folders, demonstrating best practices in **network security** and **data protection**.

## ⭐ Features  
- 🖥️ **TrueNAS** configuration  
- 🔐 **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- 🗄️ **SMB Shares**  
- 🌐 **Static IP configuration**  
- 🖱️ **Mapped network drives**  
- 📂 **Active Directory (AD) Integration**  

## 🏆 Highlights  

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
   The role-based approach allowed me to create security groups to manage folder permissions. This ensured that users only had access to the resources they were authorized to use, providing a secure and efficient file-sharing solution within the network.

2. **Network Drive Mapping**  
   The network drives were successfully mapped to ensure seamless access to shared resources across the network. This streamlined file access, making it easier for users to work collaboratively without the need for manual configurations.

3. **Active Directory Integration**  
   By integrating with Active Directory, I centralized user management and permissions. This ensured that user credentials were securely managed and allowed for easy adjustments to access control based on group memberships, simplifying administration and enhancing security.

## 📝 Conclusion  
Network mapping helps organize and connect resources, streamlining file sharing. Restricting access to these resources is essential for safeguarding data and preventing unauthorized access.
